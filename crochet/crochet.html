		Crocheting is a fairly new hobby of mine; I only started crocheting last summer. 
		My main motivation for learning crochet was to learn amigurumi to make cute plushies. 
		I remember that the learning curve was quite big in the beginning, however with practice 
		it became easier. The main things I have been crocheting so far are plants, specifically 
		hanging plants for car decoration. Below you can see some of the things I have made.
