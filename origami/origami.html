			Origami is one of my oldest hobbies. It was my brother who first introduced it to me. 
			Throughout the years, I have been on and off this craft. Origami is quite simple for the most part, however,
			doing modular projects is time consuming. Creating mutiple pieces and finally putting them all 
			together is tedious; But, the end product amazes me. Me and brother have created many origami pieces, 
			most of them we have given away to people. The picture above is the few pieces we have in our home currently:
