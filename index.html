		Hello everyone! I am currently a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison pursuing 
		my B.S. in Electrical Engineering. I have always been a curious child who wanted to figure 
		things out, which has lead me to the path of engineering. As a introvert,
		I prefer the company of a few rather than a whole crowd, and hence I am a homebody person. 
		Liking the company of a few peeople, I value meaningful connections and trust in each other. 
		Another core value I hold is of family. Coming from an Asian faimily, being close knit 
		is something that has been ingrained onto me from a young age.
